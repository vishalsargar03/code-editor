# Realtime Code Editor Integrated with Scalable Chat System - MERN Stack Project

## Overview

This project is a Realtime Code Editor implemented using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, redis) stack. It leverages WebSocket technology for real-time connections and allows users to create and share coding rooms for collaborative coding sessions.

## Features

- Real-time code editing and collaboration
- Room creation and sharing
- Syntax highlighting for popular programming languages
- chat system for communication 
  

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - WebSocket API for real-time communication
  - CodeMirror for code editing and syntax highlighting
    

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB for database
  - WebSocket (Socket.io) for real-time communication
  - Redis to store and retrieve chat to make it persistant
